• What is meant by polymorphism ?
   Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.
   
• How does polymorphism work in the above program?
   I used polymorphism to change the variable in the same method in every class.
   
• The method introduceYourself of Animal appears to be never called? Why not?
   Because we didn't create an Animal object to call that method out.
   
• Comment out the method introduceYourself in Dog. What happens now when you run the program?
   The output will be 
     ----jGRASP exec: java Quiz2.Lab1Stage1
 Meow.I am a cat.My name is Kurre.
 Moor.I am an animal.
 Meow.I am a cat.My name is Bamse.
 
  ----jGRASP: operation complete.
   
• Where is the name stored for the instances of Cat and Dog? (In what / which classes did you put the instance variable that refers to the name of the animal? Both Cat and Dog, or just in Animal?)
   Just in Animal class.
   
• How does the code in the test program work?
   I have used the concept of OOP, polymorphism, inheritance , override, overloading, getter and setter to make it work.
   
• How does an array work?
   An Array work when u create an array object and give size to the array.
   
• In the above programs we have used a while loop to step through the array and to get information about the animals. But there is a more appropriate loop statement here. What is it?
   The better loop statement is the FOR loop. Because it let u have 3 statement in it and can make the code shotter and simpler.*/
